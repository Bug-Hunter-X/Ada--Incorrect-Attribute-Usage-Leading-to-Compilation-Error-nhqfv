# Ada: Incorrect Attribute Usage Leading to Compilation Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming related to the misuse of attributes, specifically the 'Img' attribute.

The `bug.ada` file contains code that attempts to use the 'Img' attribute (intended for modular types) with an Integer type. This results in a compilation error.

The `bugSolution.ada` file provides a corrected version of the code, showing the proper way to achieve the desired result.

This example highlights the importance of understanding attribute usage and type compatibility in Ada.
